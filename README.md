# TUG-Signal-Measurement

## This repository contains the code used in the TUG Kinetikos project and the associated thesis. The thesis can also be found in this repository. The *TUG_tutorial.ipynb* notebook goes through the entire process, while the remaining files only contain certain segments of the process. *tug_example_full.py* also contains the entire process, however its purpose is not to demonstrate or explain, but instead to quickly obtain TUG test time measurements from new data.
